			<h3>Main Website</h3>
			<p>If you're looking for the actual <em>Berkeley Political Review</em> website, then click <a href="https://bpr.berkeley.edu" target="_new">this link.</a></p>

			<h3>Data Visualization Guidelines & Toolkit</h3>
			<p>We're developing a Data Visualization Toolkit, complete with interactive data visualization templates, a data visualization style guide, and instructions on how to upload your very own charts to the BPR website. Access the repository by clicking the link below. You'll be redirected to an online file system where you can access our templates and style guide. Feel free to experiment - nothing gets finalized until the Tech Department approves it.</p>

			<h3>Request a Data Visualization For Your Article!</h3>

If you can, provide as much detail as possible, including what kind of visualization you want, what kind of data we'll be usuing, and how we can find that data.</p>

			<h3>Interactive Data Visualizations</h3>
			<p>BPR now uses <em>Plotly</em> for all its data visualization needs. Plotly Chart Studio is an online platform that hosts interactive charts and graphs created in Python, R, or JavaScript. To view all of our past visualizations, click this <a href="http://plot.ly/~Berkeleypoliticalreview/" target="_new">link</a>.</p>

			<h3>Website Redesign</h3>
			<p>We're in the process of redesigning and modernizing the BPR website. Along with updating the styling of the website with the Design Department, we're also expanding the technical capabilities of the website. This means better integration for Sound Cloud, Plotly Data Visualizations, and more! Please be patient as we work to modify the website. If a page or link doesn't work, use the <a href="#notify_us">link</a> above to report a website issue.
