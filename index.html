			<p>Hello! We're the <em>Berkeley Political Review</em> Tech Department. We're responsible for keeping the BPR website up to date, creating interactive charts and other visualizations, and helping with everything tech-related at BPR. This year, we're expanding our abilities and adding new projects to our docket, so be on the lookout for cool things to come. Check out our <a href="#personnel">personnel</a> to learn more about us and to get in contact.</p>

			<h3>Data Visualization Guidelines & Toolkit</h3>
			<p>We're developing a Data Visualization Toolkit, complete with interactive data visualization templates, a data visualization style guide, and instructions on how to upload your very own charts to the BPR website. Access the repository by clicking the link below. You'll be redirected to an online file system where you can access our templates and style guide. Feel free to experiment - nothing gets finalized until the Tech Department approves it.</p>

			<h3>Request a Data Visualization For Your Article!</h3>
			<p>Have a cool idea for an interactive graph? Want to spice up your article? Consider requesting an interactive data visualization. Created by the data analysts in the Tech Department, these visualizations can represent a wide variety of data, including election results, economic data, and population trends. Use <a href="">this form</a> to request a visualization. If you can, provide as much detail as possible, including what kind of visualization you want, what kind of data we'll be usuing, and how we can find that data.</p>

			<h3>Notify Us of a Website Issue</h3>
			<p>If you encounter a bug or an issue with the BPR website (e.g. improper styling, a page doesn't load, or a link is broken), please fill out this form to notify us. Once we take a look at the issue, we'll contact you to let you know that it's been fixed (or when it will be fixed). Please be patient with your requestsâ€“we'll get around to them as soon as we can.</p>
